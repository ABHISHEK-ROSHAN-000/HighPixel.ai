                    <b>Vector</b> is a cutting-edge language model developed by <b>HighPixel.ai</b>, a pioneer in AI
                    research, and <b>Abhishek Roshan</b>, the driving force behind its creation.
                    <br><br>
                    Vector is available in various variants, each with a distinct set of parameters, including 35
                    million
                    (35M), 126 million (126M), and 162 million (162M) parameters, making it a highly optimized model for
                    on-device usage on low-end devices such as mobile phones.
                    <br><br>
                    This variant is specifically designed for low-power devices like mobile phones, where high
                    computational
                    requirements can be a significant bottleneck.
                    <br><br>
                    The training datasets for Vector are of massive proportions, totaling 50 GB, which is a testament to
                    the
                    model's scalability and adaptability.
                    <br><br>
                    Moreover, Vector is an open-source model, allowing developers to tap into its vast capabilities and
                    explore its potential in various applications, from chatbots to content generation.
